# contact-us-with-firebase

This is a contact form that not only focuses on the UI but also includes a database for receiving the information of those who filled the form.

## Database
For this, a project was created on my firebase account and linked to my local project. On the click of the submit button the information provided will be sent to the database.

An important requirement for this project was to install webpack as this contact-form was created using html, css and vanilla JavaScript.
